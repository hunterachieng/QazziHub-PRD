#  Purpose

Qazzi Hub is a social platform that is aimed at creating a source of temporary employment for skilled workers by selling their skills to interested clients for a duration of time and at an agreed amount.

The main users of the platform are clients who are seeking services such as a Software Developer, a Voice Over Specialist, or an online tutor.

The other users are the professionals who are skilled in their various fields as mentioned above and are seeking to sell their skills to those clients who are in need of their services.

The client will create a task (job) and have interested professionals bid for the task where the client will be at liberty to choose their prefered professional. When a task has been handed over to a professional, they are required to complete the allocated task in the given time frame where they will be paid with each achieved milestone as agreed by the client.
